## PQ_WORDS

* (Move some "hard" words over to "hardcore", that's why I added it.)
* (I'll do verbs, adjectives, possibly adverbs, when I need them for a new game.)

## Possible categories / improvements

EVENTS (find more) => create that category
ANIMALS (find more) => Split into more categories? (Fish? Predators?)
FOOD (find more) => Split into Vegetables and FastFood?
SPORT (find more) => research more sports (both name and the one doing it) + material
SUBJECTS => although this feels like just a short list at one complexity level (school/study subjects)
