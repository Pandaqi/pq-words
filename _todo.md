## PQ_WORDS

* Move some "hard" nouns over to "hardcore", that's why I added it.
* Enhance VERBS => check the `external word resources/verbs/` folder, which has a lot, but they're also really niche.
* See ideas below for (better) categories for nouns and verbs.

## Possible categories / improvements

EVENTS (find more) => create that category
ANIMALS (find more) => Split into more categories? (Fish? Predators?)
FOOD (find more) => Split into Vegetables and FastFood?
SPORT (find more) => research more sports (both name and the one doing it) + material
SUBJECTS => although this feels like just a short list at one complexity level (school/study subjects)
